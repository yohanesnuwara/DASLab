# DASLab

**What the heck is DAS?** DAS, stands for Distributed Acoustic Sensing, is a geophysical measurement technology that uses laser light scattering inside fiber optic cables to measure dynamic strain and seismic waves. The strain measured by DAS is analogous to pressure measured by seismic geophones. Unlike geophones which have spacing between each, DAS uses the whole fiber. This is the reason why DAS is used in seismic acquisition. Many believe, like [Bona and Pevzner (2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1071/ASEG2018abW8_4F), that DAS has many advantages such as consistent amplitudes, less tube wave, clearer reflections, faster and cheaper cable acquisition.
